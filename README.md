# AndroidAssignmentSu2025

In this assignment will be completing the implmentation of a basic task list app by filling in 7 different TODOs represting missing parts of a fully functional app.

The app will have two Activities, WatchlistActivity and AddMediaActivity

The project folder contains 7 TODOs in 4 different files:

WatchlistActivity.java contains TODO 1, 3, 5

'MediaManagerSingleton.java` contains TODO 2

activity_add_media.xml contains TODO 4

AddMediaActivity.java contains TODO 6

ExampleUnitTest.java contains TODO 7

Note that some of the TODOs are dependent on previous TODOs. So, you may want consider doing these TODOs in sequential order

Please refer to the Android Tutorial videos posted to Canvas for implementation tips.

Here is a video displaying the correct functionality of the app that you should strive for: https://youtu.be/VfLajMJY7V4?si=pKAO12THq5zjRSU4
